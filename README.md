# 👋 Oh hey, I'm Remi

Welcome to my profile! You've probably seen cooler ones, but here we are anyway.


## 🧑‍🎓 About Me

- Student by day, professional segfault generator by night (even in rust)
- I pretend to know Go, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, VueJS, and SvelteKit
- Currently studying Machine Learning and Software Engineering, because why not add more confusion to my life?
- Furry, FOSS advocate, and an unapologetic Linux fanboy (yes, I use Arch btw, and yes, you needed to know)
- I never do things right on the first try
- In a constant war against the Rust compiler. So far, I'm losing
- No I can't fix your printer
- I know Python, but I'll never publicly admit it, even though I just did :3

Check back later for updates (or don't, not like anything will change anyway).

Possible future masterpieces:
- **Go-Broke** (a budgeting app so advanced, you'll be broke before you even open it)
- **VueJS-404** (routing so advanced, you'll never find what you're looking for)
- **Furry-Finder** (algorithm so advanced it found a point of life, but still not a single furry)
